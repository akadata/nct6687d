# Smoke tests for the nct6687d driver.
#
# The build portion runs everywhere. The hardware portion needs root and a
# machine with the chip, and is skipped rather than failed without one, so this
# is usable as a plain `make check` on a build machine.
#
# What is actually asserted:
#   - the module builds for the running kernel with no compiler diagnostics
#   - it loads, registers a hwmon device, and exposes the documented channels
#   - a PWM write is applied and read back, which is the path that the error
#     propagation in store_pwm() applies to
#   - unloading leaves fan control registers as they were found
#
# What is not asserted: that any particular channel reads a plausible value. A
# channel being unpopulated on the board under test is a property of the board,
# not a driver fault, and asserting on it would make this fail on hardware it
# is not written for.
